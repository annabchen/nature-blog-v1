hello! i've been in Iguazu for the past two days, and went on a tour of the falls yesterday! man are they gorgeous („★0★„) and there were also a bunch of cute critters i'd never seen before too! the first day in town, we went on a walk through the falls at night because of the full moon. it was breathtaking, the moon was so bright :) unfortunately my blurry moon pics dont hold a candle to the real thing  

please excuse the droplets on my camera lens lol, the spray from the waterfall was so intense. the following three pics are from the Devil's Throat!

![waterfall 3]({{ '/assets/images/0611/IMG_0730.jpeg' | relative_url }})  

now these pics from the middle and lower circuits of the falls!

![waterfall 9]({{ '/assets/images/0611/IMG_0911.jpeg' | relative_url }})
looking at all these pics again is making me really want to oil paint...  

now for the critters!

this little raccoon-looking guy was so cute.. according to google this is a ring-tailed coati! there were so many around, they're such mischevious guys too :D we were sitting on a little tram and before leaving, they kept walking into it and scurrying under everyone's legs. so cute

![creature 5]({{ '/assets/images/0611/IMG_0856.jpeg' | relative_url }})

yay!! this trip has been so amazing, i'm so glad i got to see all these views in person. if only my pics could do them justice!! but if my posts can show you even a fraction of their beauty irl, then im happy!!
