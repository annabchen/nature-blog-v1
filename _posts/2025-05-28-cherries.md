i FINALLY got those images embeds on last week's flower post to work.. turns out .heic files are a no no! so in the meantime i will be relying on a web converter :'D !
anywho... i went cherry picking with my mom yesterday and took these pics! i used a digicam (which i cant seem to stop rubbing in all of my friends' faces loll i just think its so cool!!!) which im very new at! i hope they turned out well i used the food setting so the cherries look extra yummy
